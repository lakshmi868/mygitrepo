Virtualization
===================
This is the process of running multiple OS's parallelly on
a single pice of h/w.
Here we have h/w(bare metal) on top of which we have host os
and on the host os we install an application called as hypervisor
On the hypervisor we can run any no of OS's as guest OS

The disadvantage of this approach is these application running on the
guest OS have to pass through n number of lavers to access the H/W
resources.

Containarization
======================
Here we have bare metal on top of whcih we install the host Os
and on the hsot OS we install an application called as Docker Engine
On the docker engine we can run any application in the form of containers
Docker is a technology for creating thse containers

Docker achive what is commonly called as "process isolation"
ie all the applications(processes) have some dependency on a specific
OS.This dependency is removed by docker and we can run them on any
OS as containers if we have Docker engine installed

These containers pass through less no of layers to access the h/w resources
also organizations need not spend money on purchasing licenses of different
OS's to maintian various applications

Docker can be used at the the stages of S/W development life cycle
Build---->Ship--->Run

===========================================================================
Docker comes in 2 flavours
Docker CE (Community Edition)
Docker EE (Enterprise Edition)

Day 2
==================================================================
Setup of Docker on Windows 
==============================
1 Download docker desktop from
  https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

2 Install it

3 Once docker is installed we can use Power shell
  to run the docker commands


===============================================================================
Using AWS
================
1 Login in AWS account

2 Create ane new Ubuntu 20 instance

3 To connect to this ubuntu instance use gitbash
  https://git-scm.com/downloads

=====================================================================\

Images and Containers
===========================
A Docker image is a combination of bin/libs that are necessary
for a s/w application to work.Initially all the s/w's of docker 
are available in the form of docker images

A running instance of an image is called as a container

==========================================================
Docker Host: The server where docker is installed is called
               docker host

========================================================================
Day 3
========================================================================
Docker Host: The server where docker is installed is called
docker host

Docker client: This is CLI of docker which accepts the docker commands
from the users and passes to a background process called docker deamon

Docker deamon: This accepts the commands comming from docker client
and routes them to work on docker images or contaienr or the registry

Docker registry: This is the location where docker images are stored
This if of 2 type
1 Public (hub.docker.com)
2 Private: This is set up on one of our internal servers

Create a testing environment where a selenium hub container is linked
with 2 node containers one with chrome and other with firefox installed

1 Create a selenium hub container
  docker run --name hub -d -p 4444:4444  selenium/hub 

2 Create a container with chrome installed on it
  docker run --name chrome -d -p 5901:5900 --link hub:selenium 
                                            selenium/node-chrome-debug

                                           selenium/node-firefox-debug

4 The above 2 containers are GUI ubuntu containers and we can
  access their GUI using VNC viewer
  a) Install VNC viewer from
     https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/

  b) Open vnc viewer--->Public ip of docker host:5901 or 5902
     Click on Continue--->Enter password: secret

=========================================================================
Docker compose
=======================
The disadvantage of "link" option is it is depricated and 
the same individual command have to be given multiple times
to setup similar architectures.
To avaoid this we can use docker compose
Docker compose uses yml files to setup the multu container 
architecture and these files can be resused any number of time

Setup of docker compose

1 Download the docker compose s/w
  sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

2 Give execute permissions on it
  sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

3 To check if docker compose is installed or not
  docker-compose --version


Url: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
===================================================================
Day 7
==============================================================

Create a docker compose file to setup the mysql wordpress container
architecture
vim docker-compose.yml
---
version: '3.8'
services:
 mydb:
  image: mysql:5
  environment:
   MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: intelliqit

 mywordpress:
  image: wordpress
  ports:
   - 8888:80
  links:
   - mydb:mysql
...

To setup the architecture from the above file
docker-compose up -d

To stop the containers 
docker-compose stop

To stop and delete
docker-compose down

==================================================================

==============================================================================
Create a docker compose file to setup CI-CD environemnt where
a jenkins container should be linked with 2 tomcat containers
one for qaserver and other for prodserver
vim docker-compose.yml

---
version: '3.8'
services:
 jenkinsserver:
  image: jenkins
  ports:
   - 5050:8080

 qaserver:
  image: tomee
  ports:
   - 6060:8080
  links:
   - jenkinsserver:jenkins

 prodserver:
  image: tomee
  ports:
   - 7070:8080
